# Natural Test Routine

Nater is an open-source recommendation engine for automating a test routine using natural language processing techniques. 
It is based on the word embeddings generated from software documents in order to employ a recommender system which guides the creation of automated test scenarios and the tracing of covered requirements. 
In addition, it adopts association analysis re-ranking to improve the provided recommendations based on the user activity.

This engine addresses test engineers working with Model-Based Testing,
where building blocks can be teamed to implement an automated test. The user
can create a test scenario that will transform into a test ready to run and supports automatic requirement tracing. 

Experiments conducted in the European Space Agencyâ€™s Ground Segment test scenarios demonstrate the ability of this domain-specific tool to produce results close to human thinking and ease testing procedures.

### Installation

Although the engine can run on other systems, it was developed and validated using:
* Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)
* Python 3.5.2

#### Dependencies
The required python modules can be found in the requirements.txt file.

Important modules:
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (data manipulation and analysis)
* [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) (vector space modeling and topic modeling)
* [orange3-associate](https://pypi.org/project/Orange3-Associate/) (association rules and frequent itemsets mining)
* [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) (human language data processing)

The dependecies can be installed using the command:
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Make sure that you have already installed the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) command line.
